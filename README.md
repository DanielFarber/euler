# Euler

Leonhard Euler was a noteworthy mathematician and physicist.  I guess some helpful individuals have decided to memorialize him by posting a series of code challenges at [projecteuler.net].  Here are my solutions to some of those challenges.

##Notes

###Problem 1


###Problem 2
###Problem 3
###Problem 4
###Problem 5
I wrote the js version first but in Ruby, it was unbearably slow.  So, I concluded logically that the iterator could run in factors of 190 which made it instantaneous.
###Problem 6
###Problem 7
Learned a little about the Ruby Prime class, which did all of the work in my Ruby example.
###Problem 8
###Problem 9
###Problem 10
###Problem 11
The JavaScript version could be DRYer.
